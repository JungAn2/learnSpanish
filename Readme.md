# This repo is just to help me study Spanish

> All of the notes are done in obsidian so Obsidian is needed to view the notes

The Images are taken from Civitai by checking the lasted id of the image from Civitai and running random number generator from 1 to that number
## What I think will help me improve
- Spanish vocab
- Spanish grammer? (maybe)
- Learn to be more descriptive
- Be more alert to details
- Increase memorizing skill
